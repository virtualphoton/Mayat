# Mayat

**Mayat** is a code similarity detection tool developed by [Tian(Maxwell) Yang](https://github.com/AlpacaMax). It works by comparing the Abstract Syntax Trees of students' code solutions and generate a similarity score for each pair of students' code.

## Build & Install

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:AnubisLMS/Mayat.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```
cd Mayat
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```
Install Mayat
```
pip install .
```

3. Install `tree-sitter` parsers
```
python -m mayat.install_langs
```

## Usage
Let's say we need to check all students' `uniq.c` for homework1. The path for each `uniq.c` has the format `homework1/<unique-id>/user/uniq.c`. All we need to do is run:
```
python -m mayat.frontends.TS_C homework1/*/user/uniq.c
```

If we only want to check the `main` function, we can do:
```
python -m mayat.frontends.TS_C homework1/*/user/uniq.c -f main
```

Additionally, we can pass more optional arguments for `C.py`:
   - `--threshold`: Specify the granularity for the matching algorithm. Default to `5`. A smaller value will cause it to check trivial details, which increases the similarity score of two code even though they might not be similar. A larger value will cause it to overlook some common cheat tricks such as swapping two function definitions.

## Supported Languages
- **C**:
  - `mayat.TS_C`
  - `mayat.C`(Legacy)
- **Python**:
  - `mayat.TS_Python`
  - `mayat.Python`(Legacy)
- **Java**:
  - `mayat.TS_Java`

## Implement a New PL's frontend
We implement a new programming language's frontend by using classes and functions defined in `mayat`. They are:
- `mayat.AST.AST`: The base class for Abstract Syntax Tree. For a new PL you should inherit this and implement the `AST.create(path)` class method, which takes the path of a program as a parameter and returns the AST representation of that program. Currently it is preferred to use `tree-sitter` parsers to implement language frontends, whose corresponding file should be prefixed with `TS_`.
- `mayat.args.arg_parser`: A `argparse.ArgumentParser` object. We need to use this object to retrieve command arguments. We can add new arguments if needed.
- `mayat.driver.driver`: The driver function that takes the inherited AST class and the parsed arguments as parameters and run the plagiarism detection algorithm.

An example of this can be find in `mayat/frontends/TS_C.py`, which is a C frontend implemented using `tree-sitter-c` parser.

## Testing
```
cd tests
python test.py -v
```

## Limitations
This tool will never work for assembly code as the code has to be written in a high level programming language that can be converted into an AST. We can potentially figure out a way to automatically reverse engineer assembly code back to C and then convert it to AST. However, there's no guarantee that the reverse-engineered code can be a good representation for its assembly counterpart.
